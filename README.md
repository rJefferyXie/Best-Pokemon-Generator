# Best Pokemon Finder
This was a personal project where I learned how to use the open Pokemon API (pokeapi). Using the pokeapi, this program will create a list of the three best pokemon for each stat category and show you which pokemon are the strongest in a nice list format.

# Requirements and Installation 
**Required Modules**
* To install, simply enter these commands into your terminal. (for macOS users, replace pip with pip3)
  * *pip install requests*

**Setting up Repository**
* To clone repository, press the green "Code" button, and copy the HTTPS to your clipboard.
* Create a new project in your code editor or IDE of choice.
* Import the HTTPS url into version control on your new project.
* Two Examples:
  * If using pycharm, go to VCS --> get from version control --> paste the url --> clone
  * If using Visual Studio Code, go to explorer (ctrl + shift + e) --> clone repository --> paste the url --> clone

**Running**
* You can run the program by running find_best_pokemon.py!
