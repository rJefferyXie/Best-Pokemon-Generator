**This was a personal project where I learned how to use the open Pokemon API (pokeapi).**

Using the pokeapi, this program will create a list of the three best pokemon for each stat category and show you which pokemon are the strongest in a nice list format.

**To run the find_best_pokemon file, make sure you have the required modules required by entering these commands into your terminal or IDE.**
* *pip install requests*
